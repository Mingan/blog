*The Kingkiller Chronicle* is a fantasy series by Patrick Rothfuss which currently consists of two humongous books [*The Name of the Wind*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind) and [*The Wise Man's Fear*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear) plus a huge hole where the third book should be. Like many fantasy authors, Rothfuss spun off some characters into smaller pieces and [*The Slow Regard of Silent Things*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21535271-the-slow-regard-of-silent-things) is one of them.

It's hard to describe *The Slow Regard of Silent Things*. By length, it's a novelette, by the motif and atmosphere, it's a fairy tale, but it lacks a plot, characters, and any dialogue. The most exciting thing which happens is Auri making soap. Rothfuss acknowledges this is the afterword and the book even includes a warning at the beginning about its strangeness.

I think the best way to describe the book is as a meditation. It uses coherent sentences which have a meaning but very little narrative direction, most interactions are between Auri and inanimate objects, no one talks, it just sets a mood a revels in it. If you want this (or are jsut tired of waiting for the proper third installment in the series), go for this book.
