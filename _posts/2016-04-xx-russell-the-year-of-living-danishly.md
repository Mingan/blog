OK, [Helen Russell's *The Year of Living Danishly*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24359966-the-year-of-living-danishly) is the last one about Denmark for a while.

Since I've read a few books about Denmark, I had some expectations going in. The topics were pretty clear cut: happiness ratings, equality on many fronts, openness, social cohesion, modesty, Janteloven, Nordic cuisine, hit TV shows, welfare state, high taxes, ambiguous relationship with religion, unease about immigrants, crazy language etc. Everything was there in some form or another, but there is a difference.

*The Year of Living Danishly* is structured as a story with many factographic detours along the way. Rusell describes her move from the frenzy of a London to rural Jutland. She embodies the image of a modern person being dragged through life by deadlines and notifications, never having time for anything, failing to reach and even have personal dreams, and starting to see health problems. Her husband seems to be much more relaxed but not happy either and when he's presented with an opportunity to work for [**l***E*g*O*](/articles/randall-munroe-what-if) in Billund he accepts, they pack up their lives and move for a year.

The author takes this year as an opportunity to research the consistently high scores of Danes in happiness polls and uses this is an excuse to learn about Denmark. She talks to all sorts of people from different walks of life but mostly to researches. She has a tendency to quote one study per five pages, which becomes a bit tiring especially considering that most of the studies mentioned come from social sciences and should be taken with a [grain of salt](http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2016/03/lexicographer_ben_zimmer_on_the_etymology_of_taking_something_with_a_grain.html). These factual passages are mixed with personal stories and anecdotes of their attempts to fit in chronologically over the year.

One has to wonder how much are the stories embellished and reordered to fit this structure. Personally, I had a little problem with over emphasized naivety, but it was balanced by very witty writing. I accumulated dozens of highlights, some factual tid bits but majority are just funny descriptions.

From this genre, *Year of Living Danishly* is in the better half. It's not a "reference manual" with nicely labeled chapters, but conveys the same information in a story based form in a very entertaining writing style and even a character development arc (though exaggerated).

There is even a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1RXGltx4SI) which summarizes the book, it uses some of the same jokes but they land better in written form.
