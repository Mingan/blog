[Randal Munroe's *What If*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if) has been on top of every chart imaginable and people love it. There's nothing of substance  I can add to that.

I'm not a devout reader of XKCD but enjoy it quite a bit. Pretty much the same goes for the book. I've read it within four days because it's fascinatin and funny.

Which questions did like the most:

- spent nuclear fuel pool,
- laser pointers,
- hair dryer,
- last light on after a sudden dissaperance of humans,
- elimination of common cold by complete isolation,
- half empty glass,
- longest free-fall,
- **l***E*g*O* bridge over Atlanitc,
- drainage of oceans - go South Netherlands! - and
- oceanification of Mars - go New Netherlands!

and of course the worrying questions from the inbox.

Which I didn't like:

- time travel to New York - what's the point?,
- most flown over state,
- longest sunset - I totaly didn't get this and
- neutrino bullets - what do people have about bullets and guns? 

If you're at all curious about the world go and read or listen to it.
