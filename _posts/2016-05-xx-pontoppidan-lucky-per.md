Reading about Denmark pointed me in the direction of actual Danish literature which is apparently focused in [*Lykke Per*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26171634-astn-per) by Henrik Pontoppidan, a Nobel laureate. I was little sceptical about it. The book was written at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and has received a lot of acclaim when published.

It turned out to be pretty much as I expected: almost seven hundred pages of a very strange plot with caricature characters and endless musings about purpose and belief. Many reviewers are delighted by his style and breath of the vocabulary but if it's there, it didn't really translate.

Others are excited by the breath of the characters. They must have been reading a different book apparently. The main protagonist, Per, acts keeps finding new ways how to act like an idiot in every chapter - he rebels against his religious family, tries to buy his way into better society and makes ends meet only because of generosity of an acquaintance (who   makes Per his heir before committing suicide), treats the people around him like crap if he doesn't a way how to benefit from them directly, throws away his education, despises the free-spirited artists he hangs out with, abuses his benefactor, cheats on his fiance and so on and so forth. Per's is despicable and one has a strong urge to slap him every other page.

The other characters are mostly caricatures - his religious family, siblings who had to grow up too early, conservative public servants hindering his master plan, tragic artists, or money hungry financiers who don't understand the meaning of his project. Basically the only character with any depth is his fiance, Jakobe, and her after-Per story might make for a good novel.

A positive aspect of the book is that it is rather readable. Despite its age the style isn't as convoluted as it could have been. Admittedly, it might have been modernized slightly during translation in 1980's.

Personally, I hope modern Danish literature is more readable. *Lykke Per* really felt like a required reading without any emotional payoff.
