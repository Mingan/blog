[Tony Horton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Horton_(personal_trainer)) is one of those trainers who sells his DVD programs on late night US infomercials. I was introduced to his home exercise program P90X by a friend roughly five years ago and it has changed. Initially, I lost a lot of weight, then gained some muscle and managed to maintain it for several years. There was a dip during the stress of finals and such, but it changed my attitude towards physical exercise.

By using P90X and now P90X3, I've been hearing Tony's jokes for years and years and can repeat his lines verbatim, so I thought Imi ght read one of his books even though self-help is not my favorite genre.

As the title suggest, [*The Big Picture*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18090134-the-big-picture) is built around eleven *laws* of life. Each is applied to both fitness and life in general with differing level of success. The core ideas are pretty sensible and the sort of thing you'd expect: find your purpose so that you can draw on it for motivation, have a notion of a plan how to reach it, try your best and celebrate progress, be consistent yet flexible etc. He tries to balance the line between being prescriptive and not deterring people from healthy lifestyle. I'm sold on the benefits of balanced diet and exercise so it's hard for me to judge how an outsider might judge it.

What I can appreciate is the focus on physical well being as a precondition to mental and emotional well being. I see many people who complain about not sleeping well, being tired, irritable and they have very little activity. I'm by no means very active and haven't been sticking too much to any training plan for months but I make sure to at least get few tens of floors climbed and 10K steps every day. Every time I fail to do so, I feel without energy and useless. Tony iterates on this idea in each chapter (no wonder, it's his livelihood) as well as on getting enough rest and time to relax. On top of things, it's a book by Tony Horton, so there are his typical jokes.

> As a race, we happen to excel in finding ways out of “almost impossible” situations. Wars, plagues, financial crises, disco.

On the downside, he illustrates numerous points using anecdotal evidence - this is to be expected from a trainer selling you his products but he tries to make large claims about health without corresponding sources. In places, he mentions studies but without proper citation (making it hard to track down) and even presents them in a dubious way (usually tries to argue causation where evidence exists for correlation at best). He also pushes a lot of pseudoscience based on the natural fallacy &mdash; detoxification (through yoga), organic vegetables, free range meat.

I'm biased but *The Big Picture* is not great. Yes, it is a motivation book which can help the reader get over a slump. It can also be read in a reasonable way with good advice. However, it contains a lot of nonsense as well which brings it down quite a bit.
