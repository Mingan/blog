[Very British Problems](https://twitter.com/SoVeryBritish) is a comical Twitter account posting about all the terrible obstacles a normal Brit has to overcome in order to have a cup of tea. It has been published as a book grouping the situations by topics and due to the staggering amount of life complications a [second volume](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25758341-very-british-problems-abroad) came into existence as well. This time Brits leave their homeland and wander around he globe.

*Very British Problems Abroad* are structured into topical chapters consisting of tweet sized anecdotes. Some are hilarious, some funny, some ok, and some just stupid. In few places the material was turned into a longer format (like he Very British Hotel Handbook) which breaks the monotony of 140-ish character jokes. For my taste, there could be more longer form passages but it's a fun travel read, nevertheless.

There isn't much more to say except: follow the Twitter account for daily dose of British problems and read it on vacation if it crosses your path, if not, don't worry.
