The most recent addition to my _read_ shelf on GoodReads is a thick book called _[Signal and Noise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22386827-sign-l-a-um)_ by Nate Silver. Due to its length (450 pages of text, over 100 pages of references) and large hard cover Czech version it isn't a book you can read on a train so it takes time get through it.

The book was recommended to me in a context of a discussion about Gleick's _[Information: History. Theory. Flood.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21480796-informace)_ and
    [Taleb's](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb) books last year. I had absolutely no idea who the author is but apparently [Silver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver) is some sort of public figure with his own share of controversy and criticism.

The topic of the book are predictions in all fields and forms imaginable. Silver opens with a brief analysis of the economic crisis which covers poor predictions by investors and private forecasters, absurd position of rating agencies and poor predictions of impacts of measures taken by public authorities. The key message is that it's very hard to predict things that have never happened in the past (black swans) especially if you're personally interested in not recognizing them and riding the way as far as possible no matter what.

 The following chapter covers his current topic of interest predictions in politics. Three signs of bad predictions are covered:

 1) Black & white predictions
 2) Lack of revisions of the predictions
 3) Individual predictions far away from from the mainstream just for the sake of publicity

Another point that gets repeated throughout the book is a lack of accountability. No one scores TV commentators on accuracy of their predictions. If they're wrong nobody cares, if they're correct they can bask in the limelight (especially when they have an outlandish prediction).

Next, unwieldy fields of politics and economy are contrasted with a very structured baseball  which offers significantly better conditions for predicting the careers of individual players, results of games or the whole teams. I no next to nothing about baseball but the argument about structured environment, rules and the emphasis of mental aspects (teams in the highest competitions apparently play several times a week) of the players make sense.

Independent weather forecasting is the winner of the book. Sort of. Even though the mechanisms of the weather are pretty well known on small scale accurate forecasting is hard due to the complexity and dynamic nature of the problem (Lorentz, butterfly effect, etc.). Many fold growth of the computing power used for weather forecasting has translated into more accurate short term forecasts over the decades. However, the improvement is in the range of tens of percents, not hundreds. An important aspect of commercial weather forecasts is their tendency to predict more rain with a true pessimistic logic - if it rains, we're good, if it doesn't people are happy.

Silver moves from weather to earthquakes. Even though the large scale predictions and expectations based on the [Gutenberg-Richer law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law) are incredibly precise but only in the sense that earthquakes of any given magnitude come on average so and so often. The law doesn't help in predicting when and where will the next earthquake occur. Every model so far has failed by either predicting earthquakes that never came or by missing some that did. Many of those fail into the trp of overfitting, i.e. trying to explain all past data points as much as possible and losing the signal in the noise.

The following chapter takes a stab at economists and their inability to predict macroeconomic indicators. Silver identifies inaccurate data, too black & white sources and complex, dynamic and highly social structure of the economy as the root causes. As a solution, he suggests prediction markets which would help realign the interests of people and organizations predicting the future and consumers of their predictions. The social aspect of systems is discussed more thoroughly in relation with the spread of diseases. Any prediction in about a system with a social aspect known by the people who constitute the system can become self fulfilling or self depreciating by people acting upon that information. Even the growing computational power doesn't help much with agent based modelling of disease outbreaks.
